- 👋🦦 Hi, I’m @kingchazzy 🤨 yeah me...🤫
- 📚✔️ I’m interested in new Skills and love to lean new stuff.
- 👨‍💻 I’m currently learning to build Online Shops and Advertise them.
- 🤜🏻🤛🏻 I’m looking to collaborate? No, I just want to learn things first and know my stuff 😇
- 🕴🏻 How to reach me ... maybe 🥷 over some private message, I don't know. I'm not going to be that active here, I think 🤷‍♂️ because I stumbled across coding by accident, I don't have a clue about it 😅. 
It's more testing and trying now and understanding something than working. Maybe one day I will have the abilities and some special skills or bigger understanding for real coding 😂
But now it seems infinitely complicated. And Jason 😒 doesn't like to talk to me that much, he just has his own language 👀.
